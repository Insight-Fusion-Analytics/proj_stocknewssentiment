So, it is worth exploring what lies ahead for the stock.",https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trending-stock-marathon-petroleum-corporation-140016861.html?.tsrc=rss,"Marathon Petroleum (MPC) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.

Shares of this refiner have returned +5.5% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.1% change. The Zacks Oil and Gas - Refining and Marketing industry, to which Marathon Petroleum belongs, has gained 3% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?

Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.

Revisions to Earnings Estimates

Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.

We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.

For the current quarter, Marathon Petroleum is expected to post earnings of $0.51 per share, indicating a change of -81.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -1.5% over the last 30 days.

The consensus earnings estimate of $8.50 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of -10.6%. This estimate has changed -5.6% over the last 30 days.

For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $12.04 indicates a change of +41.7% from what Marathon Petroleum is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -3.7%.

With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Marathon Petroleum.

Credit: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock.

Elliott Investment Management has reportedly acquired a stake exceeding $2.5bn in Phillips 66 and plans to advocate for operational changes, including the sale of the company’s midstream business.

The news has seen Phillips 66 shares rise by 3.3% in late morning trade, reported Reuters.

Last year, Elliott bought a $1bn stake in Phillips 66, prompting the company to announce a performance improvement plan aimed at enhancing shareholder returns and share price.

Despite these efforts, Elliott has expressed dissatisfaction, stating that the plan “failed to materialise, and it has become evident that urgent changes are needed”.

The investment firm highlighted that Phillips 66′ share performance has not kept pace with its competitors.

Elliott said: “A streamlined Phillips would include the sale or spin-off of the midstream business, the sale of the company’s interests in CPChem and the sale of the JET retail operations in Germany and Austria.”

An investor suggested that if Phillips 66 sells or spins off its midstream business, it could be valued at more than $60bn.

Phillips 66 has not yet responded to a request for comment on Elliott’s plans for its midstream business.

As of the last stock close, Phillips 66 had a market capitalisation of $51.09bn, according to LSEG data.

Elliott has emphasised the need for new independent directors on Phillips 66′ board to increase accountability and oversee a management review.

The hedge fund has also urged the refiner to set ambitious refining targets and focus on profitability, especially as refining margins have declined for many US operators.

Analysts from TD Cowen have weighed in, suggesting that selling the midstream business might not resolve the issues of refining underperformance and could result in more volatile earnings for Phillips 66.

Since last year, Elliott has been actively pushing for changes at various companies, with its latest move being an increased stake in oil giant BP.

The firm isn't buying into management's claims of progress, arguing that the company has underperformed for years and trails competitors like Valero and Marathon Petroleum by a wide margin. Shares of Phillips 66 jumped over 4% at 3.12pm today as investors took note.

Elliott's frustration is clear. Its latest proposal, called ""Streamline66,"" lays out a three-part fix: sell off non-core assets, ramp up refining performance, and overhaul leadership. The firm points to Phillips 66's weak marginsits refining EBITDA per barrel lags Valero's by a growing gapand says the company's structure is a mess, diluting the value of its assets. Worse, Elliott says investor trust is shot, thanks to broken promises and a CEO-Chairman setup that concentrates power at the top. The message is blunt: the status quo isn't working, and shareholders deserve better.

Phillips 66 has already offloaded $2.7 billion in assets, but Elliott says that's just a start. The activist fund is calling for new independent directors and a sharper focus on core operations to restore credibility. With the energy sector rewarding efficiency, the pressure is on. Will Phillips 66 finally follow throughor will investors be stuck waiting for another turnaround that never comes?

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) stands against the other liquefied natural gas stocks.

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas that has been reduced to a liquid state through a process of cooling, making it easier, safer, and more efficient to store and ship around the world. The global LNG trade has skyrocketed over the last few years and reached 404 million metric tons in 2023, with demand to rise by another 50% by 2040.

READ ALSO: 13 Best Natural Gas and Oil Dividend Stocks to Buy

The United States of America is the largest LNG exporter in the world, with 88.3 million tons shipped in 2024, up 4.5% from the previous year. Europe remains the top destination for American LNG, which has replaced nearly half of the Russian gas supply to the continent after the outbreak of war in Ukraine. Although last year was marked by slow growth, these numbers are expected to receive a significant 15% boost in 2025 due to several new projects coming online, notably the Plaquemines LNG and Corpus Christi LNG Stage 3 projects. These expansions could pay big dividends for the country’s LNG-focused companies, given the demand grows as predicted and prices stay attractive. On their current trajectory, the ballooning LNG exports would support nearly half a million domestic jobs annually and contribute $1.3 trillion to US GDP through 2040 while having a negligible impact on domestic gas prices, according to figures from S&P Global.

Another point to note is that the United States is now capable of exporting LNG at such historic levels without impacting supplies to its own people. The US natural gas output stands near an all-time high and nearly 90% of it remains available for domestic consumption. At the same time, natural gas prices for American households continue to be among the lowest in the world.

The American LNG sector is expected to receive a significant boost after President Donald Trump issued an order last month for the country to resume processing export permit applications for new LNG projects, reversing a pause on permits for new projects that former President Joe Biden put in place early last year to study the environmental and economic effects of the booming export industry. Several key LNG importers from Asia have hailed the move as a necessary step for maintaining their energy security and decarbonizing their energy systems in the long run. Even just a few days ago, after a round of talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, President Trump announced that Japan will soon begin importing a record amount of new shipments of American LNG.

Exxon plans to boost output capacity this year to 940,000 barrels per day (bpd) versus the 616,000 bpd it produced in 2024 after upgrades at two of its three floating oil facilities and the arrival of a fourth vessel, Alistair Routledge, president of Exxon Guyana, said at a press conference.",https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/exxon-expand-oil-gas-output-150252185.html?.tsrc=rss,"By Kemol King

GEORGETOWN (Reuters) - A consortium led by Exxon Mobil has requested environmental permits from Guyana for its eighth project, the first that will generate gas not linked to oil production, and to explore another well at its massive offshore block, the head of the U.S. oil major in Guyana said on Wednesday.

Exxon plans to boost output capacity this year to 940,000 barrels per day (bpd) versus the 616,000 bpd it produced in 2024 after upgrades at two of its three floating oil facilities and the arrival of a fourth vessel, Alistair Routledge, president of Exxon Guyana, said at a press conference.

The consortium, which includes Hess and CNOOC, is responsible for all production in Guyana. It aims to lift production capacity to more than 1.7 million bpd by the end of 2029 once its first seven offshore projects are online, Routledge said.

In 2030, the eighth project, Longtail, is expected to add up to 250,000 barrels per day of crude output capacity and 1 billion cubic feet per day of gas production, he added.

Guyana has been pressing Exxon to produce and deliver more natural gas, part of the government's strategy to rely on the fuel for power generation, to industrialize the country and begin petrochemical and liquefied natural gas (LNG) businesses that can expand revenue.

The consortium recently completed a long-awaited appraisal of its gas resources, which will allow a more accurate calculation of total resources available for output, said Routledge.

""All of that data is now being put back into the geologic models, reservoir models, in order to inform us of what sort of upstream development might be possible,"" he said.

The study could help integrate Exxon's efforts with a large development awarded by Guyana to Fulcrum LNG last year, aimed at designing and building the country's first LNG project.

Routledge said Exxon has not had recent conversations with the company.

Guyana's economy achieved its fifth consecutive year of double-digit growth in 2024, expanding 43.6%, driven by crude production. Oil output rose 58% from 391,000 bpd in 2024.

The Exxon group's fourth project, Yellowtail, is on track to start up soon upon arrival of a floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) facility from Singapore, built by SBM Offshore, the company said.

Exxon expects to start pumping oil from its fifth, sixth and seventh projects - Uaru, Whiptail and Hammerhead- between 2026 and 2029.

""This year, we'll actually be undergoing installation activities, which have started for Uaru. We'll be doing some for Whiptail, as well as completing the work on the Yellowtail project,"" Routledge said.

Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) announced its earnings for the fourth quarter and full year of 2024 on January 31, 2025. This article updates my previous article published on Gurufocus on February 21, 2024.

Exxon Mobil is a leading oil supermajor, ranked 15th in the S&P 500. It is known for consistently increasing its dividends annually, making it a dividend aristocrat. For the fourth quarter of 2024, the quarterly dividend was raised by 4.2% from the previous quarter, reaching $0.99 per share. This increase, which is above the average market rate, translates to a yield of 3.7%, a significant return for investors.ExxonMobil operates in three main segments: upstream (oil and gas production), downstream, and chemicals, including specialty products. The company is also developing low-carbon solutions and emerging energy sources.

However, the upstream operations are the primary focus, generating approximately 83% of the company's total earnings in 4Q24, as shown in the graph below:

ExxonMobil: Possible Weakness in 2025

Analyzing Exxon Mobil without mentioning Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) would be a significant error. ExxonMobil and Chevron have similar valuations, are in the same oil and gas industry, and pay attractive dividends (4.6% for Chevron, while ExxonMobil's is 3.7%). Chevron is ranked 28th in the S&P 500 and is a dividend aristocrat as well.

From the perspective of a savvy investor, both companies stand out as top choices in the oil and gas industry. However, there are some differences between them. Chevron is regarded as more stable, known for its consistent returns and lower volatility. In contrast, ExxonMobil adopts a more aggressive strategy that is more sensitive to fluctuations in oil prices. For those who cannot afford to invest in both, my analysis will help you choose the one that suits you best. I will provide a detailed analysis of Chevron following this article about ExxonMobil.

CEO Darrel W. Woods said in the conference call:

Financially, we demonstrated our steadily improving earnings power across a range of metrics. We delivered earnings of $34 billion in 2024, our third highest result in a decade despite softer market conditions. Over five years, we've grown earnings, excluding identified items, a compounded annual growth rate of nearly 30%. We generated cash flow from operations at $55 billion, also our third highest in a decade to fund profitable growth, maintain our financial strength and reward shareholders.

XOM's total revenue for 2024 was $339.25 billion, reflecting a 1.5% decrease from the previous year, while Chevron's total revenue for the same year stood at $202.79 billion, excluding the HESS merger.

The energy giant will lay off 15%-20% of its workers in a bid to ""simplify our organizational structure, [execute] faster and more efficiently, and position the company for stronger long-term competitiveness,"" Chevron Corp. Vice Chair Mark Nelson said in a Wednesday statement.

Chevron’s global headcount at the end of 2023 consisted of more than 40,200 non-service station employees and nearly 5,400 service station workers, according to its most recent annual report.

Nelson said the company will finish ""most"" of the layoffs, which start this year, before 2026’s year-end.

""We do not take these actions lightly and will support our employees through the transition. But responsible leadership requires taking these steps to improve the long-term competitiveness of our company for our people, our shareholders and our communities,"" the Chevron vice chair wrote.

The energy giant aims to shrink its structural costs through layoffs and other actions by $2-$3 billion before 2027, according to Nelson.

CFO Eimear Bonner said in November, when the company released its third-quarter financial results, that Chevron aimed to achieve that level of savings. She indicated the company would give updates on its efforts ""through 2025.""

Chevron generated $52.2 billion in total revenues and nearly $3.24 billion in net income in the fourth quarter. Over the entirety of 2024, the company saw revenues of $202.79 billion and net income of $17.66 billion, with the latter of the two figures marking a 17.35% drop year over year.

The company’s global net oil-equivalent production posted a 7% increase year over year.

In this article, we are going to take a look at where Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) stands against the other liquefied natural gas stocks.

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is natural gas that has been reduced to a liquid state through a process of cooling, making it easier, safer, and more efficient to store and ship around the world. The global LNG trade has skyrocketed over the last few years and reached 404 million metric tons in 2023, with demand to rise by another 50% by 2040.

The United States of America is the largest LNG exporter in the world, with 88.3 million tons shipped in 2024, up 4.5% from the previous year. Europe remains the top destination for American LNG, which has replaced nearly half of the Russian gas supply to the continent after the outbreak of war in Ukraine. Although last year was marked by slow growth, these numbers are expected to receive a significant 15% boost in 2025 due to several new projects coming online, notably the Plaquemines LNG and Corpus Christi LNG Stage 3 projects. These expansions could pay big dividends for the country’s LNG-focused companies, given the demand grows as predicted and prices stay attractive. On their current trajectory, the ballooning LNG exports would support nearly half a million domestic jobs annually and contribute $1.3 trillion to US GDP through 2040 while having a negligible impact on domestic gas prices, according to figures from S&P Global.

Another point to note is that the United States is now capable of exporting LNG at such historic levels without impacting supplies to its own people. The US natural gas output stands near an all-time high and nearly 90% of it remains available for domestic consumption. At the same time, natural gas prices for American households continue to be among the lowest in the world.

The American LNG sector is expected to receive a significant boost after President Donald Trump issued an order last month for the country to resume processing export permit applications for new LNG projects, reversing a pause on permits for new projects that former President Joe Biden put in place early last year to study the environmental and economic effects of the booming export industry. Several key LNG importers from Asia have hailed the move as a necessary step for maintaining their energy security and decarbonizing their energy systems in the long run. Even just a few days ago, after a round of talks with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, President Trump announced that Japan will soon begin importing a record amount of new shipments of American LNG.

Most Read from Bloomberg

The US oil giant employed 46,500 people globally at the end of 2023, meaning the cuts could affect as many as 9,000 employees. The company recently moved its headquarters from San Ramon, California, to Houston, Texas, and is targeting $2 billion to $3 billion of structural cost reductions by 2026.

“Chevron is taking action to simplify our organizational structure, execute faster and more effectively, and position the company for stronger long-term competitiveness,” Vice Chairman Mark Nelson said in a statement Wednesday.

The cuts will put further pressure on US oil and gas job numbers, which are still about 10% below pre-pandemic levels despite domestic production rising close to a record high. A wave of mergers and acquisitions, improved drilling efficiency and a focus by management on profitability over production growth have all led to staff reductions and slow hiring.

Exxon Mobil Corp. has cut its global workforce by 17% since 2019 even as production boomed, helping its stock outperform Chevron’s over the past three years. Chevron has begun to make up some ground over the past year with strong growth from the Permian Basin and the recent start up of its long-delayed Tengiz development in Kazakhstan.

Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth has expressed his desire to focus on harvesting cash-flow coupled with modest spending on new projects over the next few years, potentially lessening the need for staff. Growth post-2030 is likely to come through Chevron’s $53 billion deal to buy Hess Corp., which owns a 30% non-operated stake in Exxon’s massive Guyana discovery.

The stock dropped 0.75% by 12:46 p.m. in New York, compared with a 1.5% decrease in the S&P 500 Energy Index.

“We do not take these actions lightly and will support our employees through the transition,” he said. “But responsible leadership requires taking these steps to improve the long-term competitiveness of our company for our people, our shareholders and our communities.”
